"""
M2Mconnect - this program checks wireless modem cellular network connectivity
and Raspberry Pi wwan0 interface and connects if disconnected. If eth0 or 
wlan0 has an IP then program provides a warning about multiple IP interfaces 
on Raspberry Pi but continues to connect Raspberry Pi wwan0 and the modem 
cellular PDP network connection. The program stores the modem cellular network 
IP address. This information can be used to message that IP address to server 
if required.

By default the client script is using the (telstra.extranet) APN to connect to
the cellular network, this will mean that a publicly addressable IP is assigned 
to the modem. While the IP is public the IP address is not statically assigned 
and can change between reconnection's. Teams may also wish to use the 
(telstra.internet) APN which assigns a private IP and is thus more secure.

While the modem can be assigned a public IP the Raspberry Pi wwan0 interface 
is assigned a local IP address from the modem (typically 192.168.2.2). 
If you wish the Raspberry Pi to be reached from the internet you will need to 
log into the modem config web page (telstra.4g) and configure port forward 
settings.

This script is provided as an example building block only to show what can be 
done and to give teams a basic connection script to work from. Please feel 
free to change, modify, rebuild or completely redesign components as 
specifically suits your teams chosen M2M objective.

If your team finds bugs in this baseline script or identifies better ways to
implement the baseline code that is not specific to your solution, then please 
submit modifications via github. Teams will be recognised for their 
contributions in improving the baseline code.
